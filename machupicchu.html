Machu Picchu, an Incan city of sparkling granite precariously perched between 2 towering Andean peaks, is thought by scholars to have been a sacred archaeological center for the nearby Incan capital of Cusco. Built at the peak of the Incan Empire in the mid-1400s, this mountain citadel was later abandoned by the Incas. <br>The site remained unknown except to locals until 1911, when it was rediscovered by archaeologist Hiram Bingham. The site can only be reached by foot, train or helicopter; most visitors visit by train from nearby Cusco.Machu Picchu is one of the most impressive sites in Peru — and on the planet. Built 7,000 feet above sea level, the ancient citadel dates back to the height of the Incan Empire in the 15th century. It’s estimated that only about 750 people lived here as it was a royal estate rather than a proper city. In the native tongue, Quechua, the name means “Old Peak,” but the excellently constructed site wears its age gracefully and is impressively maintained.
