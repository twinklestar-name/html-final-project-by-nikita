A mausoleum commissioned for the wife of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, the Taj Mahal was built between 1632 and 1648. Considered the most perfect specimen of Muslim art in India, the white marble structure actually represents a number of architectural styles, including Persian, Islamic, Turkish and Indian.<br>The Taj Mahal also encompasses formal gardens of raised pathways, sunken flower beds and a linear reflecting pool.The Taj Mahal is a labor of love. Emperor Shah Jahan built it in honor of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who bore 14 children but died in labor. Jahan was lost without her, and in 1631, he began construction on what is probably the world’s most elaborate and expensive mausoleum (though the tomb itself is unadorned per Muslim law). Construction required a rumored some 20,000 laborers and 1,000 elephants, who hauled marble from all over the region. The Taj is famously symmetrical, which is part of why it’s so beautiful to look at and photograph. It you go, go for sunrise before it gets overwhelmed with visitors.
