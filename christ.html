The Art Deco-style Christ the Redeemer statue has been looming over the Brazilians from upon Corcovado mountain in an awe-inspiring state of eternal blessing since 1931. The 130-foot reinforced concrete-and-soapstone statue was designed by Heitor da Silva Costa and cost approximately $250,000 to build - much of the money was raised through donations. The statue has become an easily recognized icon for Rio and Brazil.This iconic Christ statue is found in an equally iconic city, Rio de Janeiro.<br> It was completed in 1931, though a priest first proposed building a religious monument on Mount Corcovado almost a century earlier. While Christ is often depicted on a cross, this towering, bright white figure stands 98 feet tall with its arms outstretched. Generally viewed as a symbol of peace and welcoming, itâ€™s covered in thousands of small stone tiles that were painstakingly applied by devout women.
