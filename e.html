      “I began my career in web development but a few months ago. I’ve always been skilled at bringing people together and working towards common goals.  I’ve been building a career as a computer science engineer for the last two years."<BR>
      In my current role at Dr.B R Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, the efficiency of the class has been a personal focus especially as it relates to student outcomes. I set and oversee goals related to department budget and student volume. Last year, I worked with our IT department to implement a communication system for scheduling procedures and protocols to ensure that all departments were adequately staffed at all times. With our new online scheduling portal, we increased communication efficiency by 20 percent. To stay informed about their ongoing concerns, I hold regular meetings with head of department, staff and other head staff. In my role, I also manage marketing and advertising efforts on behalf of the Nitovators Team.<br>"I’ve been really enjoying that part of my work and I’m especially interested in bringing the experience I’ve gained as well as my commitment to efficiency to the team at edyoda. I’m also an avid reader and I love to hike. On weekends, you might find me at the local bookstore or exploring hiking trails in the area.I love to travel and my strong desire is to collect experience of watching all seven wonder of world.Iam enjoying both my places one is college and other is edyoda,i love to do coding inventing new things,making different projects,doing quiz and joining live sessions.
