  <!--description-->
Built between the 5th century B.C. and the 16th century, the Great Wall of China is a stone-and-earth fortification created to protect the borders of the Chinese Empire from invading Mongols. The Great Wall is actually a succession of multiple walls spanning approximately 4,000 miles, making it the world's longest manmade structure.The Great Wall is something of a misnomer. The wall is not actually continuous but many walls built at different times and for different reasons; many were joined together, but gaps still exist.<br> Some parts of the wall feel newer and almost pristine â€” these were built during the Ming Dynasty when the Ming were at war with Mongolians around the 1300s. The older walls date back as far as 700 BC, and these sections show their age today.
