The genius and adaptability of Mayan culture can be seen in the splendid ruins of Chichen Itza. This powerful city, a trading center for cloth, slaves, honey and salt, flourished from approximately 800 to 1200, and acted as the political and economic hub of the Mayan civilization. The most familiar ruin at the site is El Caracol, a sophisticated astronomical observatory. <br>Chichén Itzá is a massive Mayan city that was once a powerhouse in the area. Its heyday was from around 600 AD to 1200 AD, and its name translates to “at the mouth at the well of Itza.” As to what Itza is, it’s believed to refer to an ethnic group or translate to “enchanter of the waters.” The name makes sense either way as the Yucatán Peninsula is famous for its underwater rivers and open freshwater sinkholes, called cenotes. Water was integral to life here — and likely a factor in the city’s success before its eventual, mysterious decline.
