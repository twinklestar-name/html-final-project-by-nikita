Rome's, if not Italy's, most enduring icon is undoubtedly its Colosseum. Built between A.D. 70 and 80 A.D., it was in use for some 500 years. The elliptical structure sat nearly 50,000 spectators, who gathered to watch the gladiatorial events as well as other public spectacles, including battle reenactments, animal hunts and executions. Earthquakes and stone-robbers have left the Colosseum in a state of ruin, but portions of the structure remain open to tourists, and its design still influences the construction of modern-day amphitheaters, some 2,000 years later.The Colosseum is open from 8:30 AM to an hour before sunset every day. <br>Standard admission is about $13 and allows access to the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill. Tickets can be purchased on site, but thereâ€™s a good chance the line will be unbearably long. Consider buying a Roma Pass from a tourist office for free entry to your first two stops in the city, discounts on visits to subsequent attractions, and free transportation. Passholders can make a reservation at the Colosseum for a $2 fee and skip the line altogether.
