Petra comes from the ancient Greek “Petros,” meaning “rock,” which is a boring name for a very not boring place. Petra is in the south of Jordan between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea, a few hours’ drive from the capital city, Amman, and it’s believed to have been established around 300 BC.<br>

To access it, you have to walk about 15 minutes through a narrow canyon called the Siq. Exiting the narrow passage, you’re greeted by one of the greatest sights on Earth: the Treasury. Carved into the rock face, it’s enormous and overwhelming, and the sandstone is a kaleidoscope of pinks, oranges, and reds. The colors turn bolder and bolder at sunset, setting the city on fire — not just the Treasury but the whole city, which was forgotten until a Swiss explorer rediscovered it in 1812.
